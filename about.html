    <h1>About the Owner</h1>

    <p>Hi! My name is Emily, and I'm the owner and face behind the name "Em's Custom Cookies". <br><br>
        
        I began this business at the begining of 2023 because I've always had a huge sweet tooth and love for any and all things creative.
        One year, my mom decorated cookies for my brother's birthday party, and she soon got requests from family and friends for special orders of their own! I always enjoyed watching her,  
        and she would often let me decorate the extras. Fast forward to college, and my experience from helping my mom out helped to land me a fun part time job at a local cookie shop. 
        I got to decorate cookies and ring customers up that would come in for a little cookie fix after work or school. It was a really fun job for me. I loved getting to do something hands on while using creativity too.
        My favorite cookies to decorate are for the emoji and fiesta themed events! <br><br>
    
        I got my degree in business management, and enjoy getting to apply what I learned in school to this business. In my free time, I enjoy mountain biking with my husband or hiking with our daughter
        and two big dogs, reading, and catching up with friends over lunch or a walk. My husband and I also love to travel. Every year we strive to travel overseas and explore a part of the world we've never been to before.
